# Setup Theme-UI with Gatsby

<p>
  <a href="https://theme-ui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Theme UI
  </a>{" "}
  is a library for creating themeable user interfaces based on constraint-based
  design principles. Build custom component libraries, design systems, web
  applications, Gatsby themes, and more with a flexible API for best-in-class
  developer ergonomics. <em>I am also using theme-UI in this blog</em>.
</p>

Theme UI is currently used in Gatsby’s official themes, but it can be used in any Gatsby site or React application. It includes the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/styling/emotion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Emotion</a> CSS-in-JS library and additional utilities for styling <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/mdx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDX</a>.

## Installation

Install the following packages to add Theme UI.

```bash
npm i theme-ui gatsby-plugin-theme-ui

```

After installing the dependencies, add the following line to your **gatsby-config.js** file

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: ["gatsby-plugin-theme-ui"],
};
```

## Customization

To customize theme-UI, create a new folder **src/gatsby-plugin-theme-UI** and create a new file **index.js**.
Theme-UI uses a theme configuration object to provide color, typography, layout, and other shared stylistic values through React context. This allows components within your site to add styles based on a predefined set of values.
Add the following code to the **index.js file**

```javascript
// example theme file
const theme = {
  colors: {
    text: "#000",
    background: "#fff",
  },
};

export default theme;
```

You can customize every bit of your style by following the <a href="https://theme-ui.com/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">theme-UI</a> docs. You can also view the configuration of my blog <a href="https://github.com/subhamBharadwaz/Blog/tree/master/src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
