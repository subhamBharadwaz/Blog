# How to setup MDX in Gatsby

If you are trying to make a blog or a content-rich static website, **markdown** is the best option! But, if we can create jsx components in markdown files, it will be great, right? Well, with <a href="https://mdxjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDX</a>, we can do pretty much everything. You have full control over your documentation, testing, and design pages.

## Installation

Install the following packages

```shell
yarn add gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react
```

Let's install <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gatsby-plugin-filesystem</a> so that we can make use of frontmatter, generate Gatsby nodes from local files, and use import/export functionality in our MDX files

```shell
yarn add gatsby-source-filesystem
```

### Additional plugins

I like to create posts in a different folder named **posts**. By default, you can access pages only from the **pages folder**. To access posts from the posts folder, create a folder **src/posts** and install the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-page-creator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gatsby-plugin-page-creator</a> plugin.

```shell
yarn add gatsby-plugin-page-creator
```

And in the future, you would like to import images in mdx files also. To access photos from mdx files, you have to install one more additional plugin, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gatsby-remark-images</a>.

```shell
yarn add gatsby-remark-images
```

## Configuration

Open **gatsby-config.js** and add the following.

```javascript
{
      resolve: "gatsby-source-filesystem",
      options: {
        name: "posts",
        path: `${__dirname}/src/posts`,
      },
    },

 {
      resolve: "gatsby-plugin-page-creator",
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/src/posts`,
      },
    },

"gatsby-remark-images",
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-plugin-mdx",
      options: {
        gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [
          {
            resolve: "gatsby-remark-images",
            options: {
              maxWidth: 1200,
              linkImagesToOriginal: false,
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
```

By default, **linkImagesToOriginal** is **true**, which treats our images as a link to the original image. So, I changed it to **false**.

To give the default page layout to the mdx posts also, you have to write one more line.

```javascript
 {
      resolve: "gatsby-plugin-mdx",
      options: {
        gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [
          {
            resolve: "gatsby-remark-images",
            options: {
              maxWidth: 1200,
              linkImagesToOriginal: false,
            },
          },
        ],
        defaultLayouts: {
          posts: require.resolve("./src/components/post-layout.js"),
        },
      },
    },
```

Here, I created a component, **post-layout.js**, and gave the default layout to it. For example,

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Link } from "gatsby";
import Layout from "./layout";

export default function PostLayout({ children, pageContext }) {
  const { title, abstract } = pageContext.frontmatter;

  return (
    <Layout title={title} description={abstract}>
      {children}
      <Link to="/">&larr; back</Link>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

This setup will work fine for almost all the things you'll need.
